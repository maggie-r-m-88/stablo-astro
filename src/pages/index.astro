        Carpe Diem, which means seize the day, is a life enrichment center
        located on 44 acres nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of southwestern
        North Carolina. <br /><br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Eight miles outside of Highlands, it is, by
        intent, off the so-called beaten path. Surrounded by national forest
        lands, it is a place of trees, waterfalls, hiking trails, picnic and
        camping areas. It is a place of nature.  It is 135 miles north of Atlanta, GA, and 65 miles south west of Asheville, NC.

      <h3 class="text-xl font-medium my-4">The Labyrinth</h3>
      <p>Carpe Diem’s labyrinth is a member of the World Wide Labyrinth Association. It was created by former Highlands resident Jaan Ferree and constructed by a group of volunteers under Jaan’s direction. The labyrinth is a seven-circuit design made of rocks and stones from the land at Carpe Diem.</p>
